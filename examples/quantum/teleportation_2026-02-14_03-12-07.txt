=== Quantum Teleportation Protocol ===

Protocol Overview:
- Transfers quantum state from one qubit to another
- Uses entanglement and classical communication
- Does not transmit matter or energy faster than light
- Fundamental protocol for quantum communication

1. Protocol Setup:

Initial state:
  Alice's qubit: |0>
  Bell pair qubits: |0>вЉ—|0>

Preparing state to teleport...
Alice's qubit prepared in unknown state: О±|0> + ОІ|1>

2. Creating Entangled Bell Pair:

Creating Bell pair between Alice and Bob...
Bell pair created: (|00> + |11>)/в€љ2
  Alice holds bell_pair_1
  Bob holds bell_pair_2

3. Alice's Operations:

Alice performs Bell measurement...
  Applied CNOT(Alice_qubit в†’ Bell_1)
  Applied H to Alice_qubit
  Measuring Alice's qubits...
  Alice's measurement results:
    Qubit 1 (original): 0
    Qubit 2 (Bell pair): 0

4. Classical Communication:

Alice sends classical bits to Bob:
  Bit 1: 0
  Bit 2: 0

5. Bob's Correction Operations:

Bob receives classical bits and applies corrections...
Correction operations completed!

6. Verification:

Teleportation complete!
Bob's qubit should now be in the original state О±|0> + ОІ|1>

Verification measurements:
Performing 1000 verification measurements...
Measurement statistics:
  |0> probability: 0
  |1> probability: 0

7. Advanced: Entanglement Swapping:

Entanglement Swapping Demonstration:
Creating two independent Bell pairs...
Bell pairs created:
  Pair 1: (|00> + |11>)/в€љ2
  Pair 2: (|00> + |11>)/в€љ2

Performing Bell measurement on middle two qubits...
Bell measurement result: 00

Qubits 0 and 3 are now entangled!
Entanglement created between particles that never directly interacted

8. Quantum Teleportation Applications:

вЂў Quantum communication networks
вЂў Quantum internet
вЂў Distributed quantum computing
вЂў Quantum repeaters
вЂў Secure quantum communication
вЂў Quantum error correction

Protocol Summary:
Quantum state transferred
No-cloning theorem respected
Entanglement utilized
Classical communication required
Original state destroyed (no cloning)
