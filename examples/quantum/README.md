# Quantum Examples

This folder contains realistic quantum scenarios used by the documentation and IDE visualizers.

## Files
- `grover_search.it` — Grover search workflow with measurement loop.
- `quantum_fourier.it` — QFT with controlled rotations and measurement.
- `teleportation.it` — Quantum teleportation flow with classical channel.
- `fidelity_analysis.it` — Fidelity/measurement tracking for noisy circuits.

## Notes
- These examples are referenced from `docs/11-EXAMPLES-TUTORIALS.md` and `docs/05-QUANTUM-COMPUTING.md`.
- When updating, keep gate sequences and measurement logic coherent (avoid placeholder circuits).
